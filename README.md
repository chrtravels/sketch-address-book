# sketch-address-book

Note: you can see a test of the app at the link below but I haven't sorted Github Pages
to load the background image and fonts yet.

Site live to test at: https://chrtravels.github.io/sketch-address-book/ 

Short video of app:  https://www.loom.com/share/0fbbee5b5043486fadaf781c5ed49369 

Resources used: 

1. Wired Elements - to give a sketch style to the html elements
2. Stock background image for page body to make it purty
3. Modal - Used elements from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp
4. Used most of the search function using jQuery, from stack overflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32435494/search-filter-rows-through-multiple-tables-with-one-search-field 

Any other styling is just basic custom css. Functions are custom javascript & jQuery. 

Improvements that could be made:

1. Figure out how to use .checkValidity to check if the form fields are valid
2. Check for property form field formatting
3. Looking into device scaling (mobile first development)
4. Return the contact list in alphabetical order when a new contact is added.
5. Add an edit function
6. Move the edit and delete functions to a modal, activated by a three dot button (...)
